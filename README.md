# DNA-Analysis
This program written in C++ is able to take any string of dNTPs (deoxynucleotides) as an input and transcribe it into its corresponding RNA strand.<br>
It then translates this RNA strand into the corresponding protein according to the amino acids of triple codons.<br>
The complementary strand of DNA and its percentages of nucleotides is also given.
A string input that is not a multiple of 3 (not written as triple codons), or a character input other than A, T, C or G (case-sensitive) will display an error
