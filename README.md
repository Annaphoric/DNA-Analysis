# DNA-Analysis
This program written in C++ is able to take any string of dNTPs (deoxynucleotides) as an input and transcribe it into its corresponding RNA strand. It then translates this RNA strand into the corresponding protein according to the amino acids of triple codons. The complementary strand of DNA and its percentages of nucleotides is also given.
